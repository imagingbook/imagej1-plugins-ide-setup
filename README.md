# Setup for writing ImageJ Plugins with Eclipse, IntelliJ or NetBeans
This repo contains a minimal setup for writing ImageJ (1) plugins with the [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/), respectively.
The projects are set up with ``<project-root>/plugins/`` as the default output folder (for generated ``.class`` files).

This repository is part of the [**imagingbook**](http://imagingbook.com) support suite.
See [www.imagingbook.com](http://imagingbook.com) for additional resources.


## Setup
Clone this repository. It contains separate folders ``project-eclipse/``, ``project-intellij/`` and ``project-netbeans``, each containing a self-contained project for Eclipse, IntelliJ and NetBeans, respectively. 
Choose whichever you want to use and delete (or keep) the others.

### Eclipse:
Start the **Eclipse Java IDE** and use ``Open Projects from File System...`` to navigate to the ``project-eclipse/`` folder.
Editing and saving plugin source files should update the associated class files (in ``plugins/``) automatically.

### IntelliJ:
Start the **IntelliJ IDEA** and use ``Open`` in the *Welcome screen* to navigate to the ``project-intellij/`` folder.
Editing and saving plugin source files should update the associated class files (in ``plugins/``) automatically.

### NetBeans:
Start the **NetBeans IDE** and use ``File`` -> ``Open Project`` to navigate to the ``project-netbeans/`` folder.
After editing plugin source files, use ``Build Project`` to update the associated class files (in ``plugins/``).


## Starting ImageJ
The ImageJ runtime can be launched in various ways:
- **Windows**: Execute ``ImageJ.exe`` (by double-clicking on the file).
When ImageJ starts up, it may ask for the ``javaw.exe`` executable, typically located in ``C:\Program Files\java\jdkxxx\bin\``. In case of problems, simply delete the ``ImageJ.cfg`` file and start anew.
- **MacOS**: Launch ``ij.jar``.
- **Java**: Run the ``ij.ImageJ.main()`` method within Eclipse.

The entire ImageJ functionality is contained in the single archive ``ij.jar``. To **update** to the most recent version, simply select ``Help`` -> ``Update ImageJ...`` from the ImageJ main menu.

## Adding/editing your plugin code
Code for ImageJ plugins is contained in the ``<project-root>/src-plugins/`` directory. Plugins may be contained in Java packages (such as ``my_plugins`` in this example). **Note** that packages with plugins may only be **one level deep**, otherwise ImageJ will not find them! It is recommended to use at least one underscore (``_``) in a plugin name to make ImageJ automatically install the plugin into the ``Plugins`` menu at startup.

## Executing plugins
At startup, ImageJ automatically installs existing plugins (under the above conditions) into the ``Plugins`` menu. To execute, simply select the listed plugin from the menu.

When the plugin's source code is **edited** in the IDE, the associated ``.class`` file in ``plugins/`` is updated (by Eclipse/IntelliJ), but **not** automatically reloaded by the ImageJ runtime. To **exectute an edited plugin** in ImageJ, use ``Plugins`` -> ``Compile and Run...`` and select the associated ``.class`` file (no compiler is needed).

## Adding other libraries (jars)
This project uses **no dependency management** (such as *Maven*) to keep things simple. If any external libraries are required, just do the following:
- Copy the associated JAR file ``xxx.jar`` into ``jars/``.
- In your IDE, add the JAR file to the Java build path.
- Restart ImageJ.

Alternatively, see [this repository](https://github.com/imagingbook/imagingbook-maven-demo-project) for a minimal Maven-based ImageJ setup.
